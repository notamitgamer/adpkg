# adpkg
An adpkg package containing several Python modules for performing a variety of mathematical, statistical, and data manipulation tasks. The modules cover areas such as financial calculations, geometry, number theory, combinatorics, matrix operations, and string manipulation.  Key Features:  adcustom.py: A versatile module with functions for checking prime numbers, calculating factorials, permutations, and combinations, reversing strings, and performing matrix operations like addition, multiplication, and transposition. It also includes functions for calculating the mean, median, and mode of a dataset.  finance.py: This module features a compound interest calculator that supports various time duration formats (e.g., "5y6m", "15m", "5y").  triangle.py: A geometry module that calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula based on the lengths of its three sides. It also validates the triangle inequality theorem to ensure the sides form a valid triangle.  Usage:  The package is designed for easy integration into projects requiring these specific functionalities. Each function includes docstrings explaining its purpose, arguments, and return values, ensuring clarity and ease of use. The modules are structured to handle common input errors gracefully, providing informative error messages to the user.
